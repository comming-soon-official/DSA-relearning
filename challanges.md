##Prompt
its a day 4 of DSA challange " | 4 | Arrays | Array methods and traversals | Map, filter, reduce | ❌ |
can you construct real life problem and construct everything like a leet code problem description

##check prompt
can u check all the taks are completed or not and mention comments on above answer dont modify directly in code just mention it what are the things are not finished
